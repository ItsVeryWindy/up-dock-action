# How to contribute

You can either raise new issues or pull requests. Issues for general feedback, feature requests or bugs are accepted. 

### Submitting a pull request

Pull requests should try and follow the existing code flow. Ensure that the code still builds and all the tests pass. Only minor changes will be considered upfront (such as bug fixes, spelling mistakes etc.). Any changes, such as adding new features or large scale changes should be discussed in an issue beforehand, as they will be rejected otherwise.

### Testing

Tests should be provided alongside every change with a few minor exceptions.
